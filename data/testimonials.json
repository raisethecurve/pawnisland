Not only has my rating increased, but my understanding, perception, discipline, and passion for the game have all increased dramatically. In that time, I went from someone who just barely scratched 1400 to a high of 1760 online and feel no signs of stopping. All of my lessons had been carefully tailored to what I needed every given week. You will NOT receive generic one-size-fits-all chess courses but rather a meticulous, well-thought-out training plan that demonstrates the care and dedication Matt has to each and every one of his students. It is worth every penny.",

Matt's chess coaching services were highly praised by his peers. After working together with him for a year, I am pleased to say that the praises are indeed well-earned. From concrete chess knowledge to sports psychology, Matt incorporated all topics harmoniously in his lessons. To say I have learned a lot from him is an understatement. My USCF rating increased several hundred points from the low 1400s to a new personal high of 1743 to date. His passion for chess and his skills as an instructor speak volumes.",

He has also guided me well in my own tutoring journey as a budding coach. I can't say enough positive things about him, but if you're looking for one of the hardest working and knowledgeable players/coaches around, I can't recommend being under his wing enough.",

In addition, Matt is the most talented chess player that I have ever played. He displays not only great chess skills and amazing teaching abilities, but also the highest levels of character and integrity. It is an honor to call him a colleague and a friend.",
